Welcome 

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. The last update to this file was: **July 2, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!

## Welcome 

This is the Readme for Read & Refer website!
 I hope to provide all the necessary information and and answer any questions you may have.
 I decided to take the approach of making the website first on normal broswer format as in a laptop or computer, 
 then styled and added what was needed for tablet and mobile devices.
 It is responsive on all devices, view the website here 


## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories
## First time user goals
a.  As a first I want to be able to get the information regarding what this site is about as soon as I enter.

b. As a first time user I want to be able to know what the site is about upon entering the home page.

c.  As a first time user I want to be able to contact the creators or view their socials to contact aswell.

## Returning user goals user goals
a. As a returning visitor I want to be able to easily contact someone through the site regarding the Scottish Highlands.

b.  As a returning visitor I want to find more information regarding the scottish highlands.

c.  As a returning visitor I want to be taken to a new page when I open a link and not taken off the current page I am on.

## Frequent user goals
a. As a frequent user I want to be view the destinations talked about on a map.

b. As a frequent user I want to be left with more knowledge on the The Highlands then before I visited.

c. As a frequent user I want to be able to be able to receive more information after contacting.

## Design 


### Typograpghy



### Imagery 



### Colour Scheme




## Wireframes

For the design of my wireframes I used Balsamic, You can find the link to the site here!   
I will also include screenshots below.


![wireframe](assets/images/wireframes-two-normal.png)



![wireframe](assets/images/tablet-wireframe.png)


## Features

- The site is responsive and can be viewed on all viewports.

- Contains interactive elements and pop ups.

- Headers change colour when hovered over.

- Forms and contact section to allow users to give feedback.

## Future features

- I would also like to include a questionnaire about the highlands.

- Possibly add a game in the future to add even more interactivity.

- I would use a article element instead of a section element as I got a warning in the html validator saying I should add more h2 to h6 elemnts to that section, however I discovered this very late and knew it would not give my code any errors so I left it but will implement next time.

## Technologies used


### languages used
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Markdown
- Python 
- Flask

## Testing 
For my testing I used the W3C validator the html in my project and for javascript I used Jshint and finally Jigsaw for my CSS. 


## To test my code I did it in the following way 

- I ran the code through the three different validators for each of my three languages.

i. I would copy sections of code so as not to do a whole page and fix any problems within the section first.

ii. Paste the code into the correct tester.

iii. Once results and errors (if present) are visble, examine and correct the changes needed.
  
iv. Repeated the same process for the three languages.

- I would browse through the site on the three different types of view port to ensure it worked well.

i. I would browse through all of the site on the mobile and tablet viewports.

ii. I check all the links to make sure they worked correctly, I looked at the text content to make sure it came out the way intended.

iii. I would then make sure that all the correct text is visble and not too small, then I would interact with all the interactive elements to make sure they reacted correctly.

iv.  Open google tools and view any errors present.

v. Correct the changes if needed.

- I also viewed the site on different browsers to see how it reacted.

i. I would open up a diffrent browser be it be it mozilla,internet explorer or google.

ii. I would interact and click all the links available to make sure they worked.

iii. Interact with all interactive elements and code to make sure it ran they way its supposed to.

## Bugs and problems

- After using the Google dev tools to help correct any mistakes in my code I  came across a error of "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)" so i added a "link rel="shortcut icon" href="#" into the head of my html pages.



- When opening the the console log on my contact and signup html pages I noticed a error stating "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined" this was happening as my JS was looking for the id of "ems" on these pages so I added it to the headers on the page.



- There was a problem with my Gallery as the images would not remain visible after a short period of time, To fix this I added a "animation fill mode: forwards"


- I also added my js files into two different files as the code would not work when in the same directory.


## Deployment
To deploy my Project to Github do it following these steps

1. Open up your Github and navigate to your repository.

2. Under the Repository section click settings.

3. Locate Git hub pages by scrolling down and underneath it click the drop-down menu to     select a folder for your publishing source.

4. Click save and locate the link under the same section and click into the site.

## Changes made after deployment

- All my file paths had to be changed my background image and all my nav-bar file paths on my signup and contact html pages.

- It had to be changed by taking a / from infront of it to allow a different file path for Github pages to work deploying my site.

- I had to change my navbars on the contact and signup page from a #About to a "index.html#About" This was done on all the navbar options on the signup and contact html pages. From then all of the site worked the way it was supposed to and on all different viewports.
